# Line-Following-Car
The practice of using Arduino Mega, IR sensors and PID algorithm to create a car that automatically detects and follows the line. For further improvements, we used RPLidar to avoid obstacles and Camera to detect the traffic signs. In general, the robot can follow the line, avoid obstacles and follow the traffic signs.
