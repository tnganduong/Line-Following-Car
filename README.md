# Line-Following-Car
The practice of using Arduino Mega, IR sensors and PID algorithm to create a car that automatically detects and follows the line. For further improvements, we used RPLidar to avoid obstacles and Camera to detect the traffic signs. In general, the robot can follow the line, avoid obstacles and follow the traffic signs.

Note: Some of the code here is our draft and might not be the complete version as we stored our original code on the Raspberry Pi and accidentally deleted the file on our local machine. That's why we cannot upload the fullest version of this project.
